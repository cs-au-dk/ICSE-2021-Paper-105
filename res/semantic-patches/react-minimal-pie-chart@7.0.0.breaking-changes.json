This means that if you provide a custom event handler for onClick, onMouseOver or onMouseOut your function will need to return void now. The signature of the expected eventhandler was [(event, data, dataIndex) => {}](https://github.com/toomuchdesign/react-minimal-pie-chart/tree/v6.0.1#options) and is now [(event, data, dataIndex) => void](https://github.com/toomuchdesign/react-minimal-pie-chart/tree/v7.0.0#options)",
