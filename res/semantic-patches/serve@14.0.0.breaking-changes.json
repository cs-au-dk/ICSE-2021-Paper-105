The Process of migrating from CommonJS to an ES module includes a lot of small changes, and since serve v. 14.0.0 does not fix any immediate security or functionality flaw, you may stay on version 13. If you want to upgrade, we recommend following one of the many guides available, for instance: https://electerious.medium.com/from-commonjs-to-es-modules-how-to-modernize-your-node-js-app-ad8cdd4fb662. You may also use a dynamic import to load the ES module if you want to continue to use CommonJS https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.",
