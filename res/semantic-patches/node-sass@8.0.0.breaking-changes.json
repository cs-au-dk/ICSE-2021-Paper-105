    "description": "Set rejectUnauthorized to true by default (@scott-ut, #3149).\nThis change solves a security issue, [rejecting any connection which is not authorized with a certificate authority](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createserver_options_secureconnectionlistener). This can be breaking if you are compiling data from hosts with self-signed certificates, in which case some hosts might be rejected. To override this new default `rejectUnauthorized` value, you can set the new `sass_reject_unauthorized` variable to false. This variable can be declared in [three different ways](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#binary-configuration-parameters), where we recommend either parsing it directly in the command line as `--sass-reject-unauthorized=false` if you are using the CLI or declaring it in either a local or global .npmrc configuration file as `sass_reject_unauthorized=false` ([see guide](https://stackabuse.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-configuring-npm/)).",
