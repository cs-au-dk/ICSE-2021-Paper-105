Previously triggering events natively (without the `$.trigger()` method) like using `HTMLElement.focus()` would not make the event bubble up. This has now been changed to match jQuery, and a call to for instance `HTMLElement.focus()` would be made a bubble event triggering event listeners like `$.on(‘focus’, listener)` on any parent element of `HTMLElement`.",
